# 🧮 Calculator Project

This is a simple **web-based calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It performs basic arithmetic operations and provides a clean, responsive interface for performing calculations in the browser.

This project was built as part of my **internship** to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and front-end UI design.
